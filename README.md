# Hashira Assignment ‚Äì Polynomial Solver

This project implements a **polynomial solver** that reconstructs a polynomial from its given roots.  
The roots are provided in **JSON format**, and each root is expressed in different number bases.  
The program reads the JSON input, converts all roots into decimal, and solves for the polynomial coefficients.

## üìå Problem Statement

- **Input**: JSON file containing:
  - `n`: number of roots provided
  - `k`: minimum number of roots required (`k = m + 1`, where `m` is the degree of the polynomial)
  - Roots: given by `"base"` and `"value"`
- **Output**:
  - Polynomial coefficients
  - Wrong Data Set Points (roots not used because they exceed the required `k`)
